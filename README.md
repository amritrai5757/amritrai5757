Commit changes in a brach Codespace -> Push to brach in Personal repo -> Make pull request to brach in Company repo

1. FORK the whole company repo to your own github.
2. Open the brach you have to work on in your own github ac.
3. COMMIT to that brach to save code/changes in codespace along with timestamp & message
4. PUSH the commits/Code from codespace to that brach in ur own repo.
5. SYNC FORK/FETCH to update to yr brach in repo with new changes made on company repo's brach by others.
6. NOTE: While SYNC FORK ,if changes made on file in company repo & changes made on file by you is same file then CONFLICT will occur & u need to resolve it. 
7. Make a PULL REQUEST/Contribute to that brach in company repo to MERGE your code in their repo.

NOTE: Fork copies whole repo with all braches.
      But Commit,Push,Pull request,Sync/fetch is done only done on single brach which u are given to work on.
